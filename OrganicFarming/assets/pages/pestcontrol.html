                    <p>In organic Farm, Pest control is not about killing - it's about creating balance. Our guide
                        teaches you how to protect your plants using eco-friendly , chemical-free methods that works
                        with nature instead of against it.</p>
                    <p>When you care for your soil using compost, cover crops, crop rotation, and natural fertilizers,
                        you build a foundation that supports strong, resilient plants and nutrient- rich harvests.
                        Healthy soil also holds water better, resist erosion, and stores carbon - helping fight climate
                        change from the ground up.</p>
